/**
 * There are 3 different ways to add tags to a meter. All of them are controlled by the
 * annotation values. Precedence is to first try with the {@link ValueResolver}. If the
 * value of the resolver wasn't set, try to evaluate an expression. If thereâ€™s no
 * expression just return a {@code toString()} value of the parameter.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Provided tag values MUST BE of LOW-CARDINALITY. If you fail to provide
 * low-cardinality values, that can lead to performance issues of your metrics back end.
 * Values should not come from the end-user since those most likely be high-cardinality.
